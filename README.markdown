# jenkins-demo

This repository contains the [Puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/) manifests to provision and create a
standard Jenkins demo environment either on a physical host, or on a virtual
machine with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).


The reason for the structure of this repository is two-fold:

* Set up a compelling demonstration environment that can be used by just about
  anybody around the world.
* Demonstrate managing Jenkins installations with Puppet
